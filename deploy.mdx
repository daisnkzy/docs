<Note>
  To deploy your Nuxt application on the Edge, we use Cloudflare Pages. Therefore, we require you to create a [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) account. **You can deploy NuxtHub projects with a free Cloudflare account.**
</Note>
  ## Deploy to NuxtHub
<Steps>
  <Step title="NuxtHub Setup">
    Sign In to [Nuxthub admin](https://admin.hub.nuxt.com) and click the **New Project** button.

  </Step>
</Steps>

Nuxthub will start building your site. This will take around 2-3 minutes.

<Info>
  **The first build may fail** as NuxtHub sets up bindings, triggering an automatic redeployment. This is expected and can be ignored.
</Info>

## Local Development

Once your project is deployed, you can use the remote storage in your local project.

<Note>
  Make sure you already have generated the migrations with 
  `pnpm db:generate`
</Note>

Start your Nuxt project with:

```sh
npx nuxt dev --remote
```

**That's it\!** The migrations get applied manually to **Cloudflare D1**.

## NuxtHub CLI

If you make any changes to your code, you can deploy with a single command:

```sh
npx nuxthub deploy
```
<Tip>
  You can access the [NuxtHub Docs](https://hub.nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deploy) to learn more about the deployments and other nuxthub features.
