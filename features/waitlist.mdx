### Why This Approach?

Iâ€™ve done extensive research on waitlist implementations, and hereâ€™s what I found:

- **The Traditional Way:**
  1. Set up a database.
  2. Build backend functionality to store emails.
  3. Create an admin panel to manage them.
  4. Users enter their email, and it gets saved in the database.
  5. â€¦And thatâ€™s it. No guidance on how to actually send emails to your list.
- **The SaaS Way:**
  1. Use a third-party waitlist service.
  2. Integrate their API into your app.
  3. Pay for both the email service and the waitlist SaaS.
  4. **But bro, weâ€™re a startup, not millionaires.**

### A Smarter Solution

Iâ€™ve reimagined the waitlist feature using **Resendâ€™s new Broadcast feature**â€”a simple and efficient way to send bulk emails.

**Why is this better?**\
âœ… **Already integrated into StartEase**â€”just start collecting emails anywhere.\
âœ… **No need to reinvent the wheel**â€”all emails automatically appear in Resendâ€™s dashboard.\
âœ… **Full management system**â€”including automatic unsubscribes.\
âœ… **Generous free plan**â€”more than enough for most startups.
