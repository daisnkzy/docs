## Introduction

[StartEase](https://startease.dev/) uses [nuxt-auth-utils](https://github.com/Atinux/nuxt-auth-utils) for authentication. It provides effortless authentication for Nuxt apps with secure, sealed cookie-based sessions.

<Tip>
  Authentication is the **bridge** between **traffic and conversions**.
</Tip>

After extensive research, we've distilled the best practices into a login process that's as lightweight and effective as possible for StartEase.

- **Minimalist Login Form.** Users only need to enter their emailâ€”nothing more.

- **Passwordless Design.** Users hate remembering anything.

  1. âœ… **No more** _"Your password must be at least 8 characters"._ 
  2. âœ… **No more** "_Incorrect password, try again"._
  3. âœ… **No more**  "_Reset Password"._

When users log in for the first time, their information is stored in a cookie, so they donâ€™t have to log in again.

- **Simple Authentication Methods**
  1. âœ… Social Logins (Google, GitHub, and more)
  2. âœ… One-time Passwords (OTPs)
  3. âœ… Magic Links

  >_Too many login options overwhelm users and slow them down._

  >_Instead, we offer the simplest, most seamless ways to sign in._

## Magic Link & OTPs

Fill in the following variables in the `.env` file.

```javascript
 BASE_URL=
 FROM_EMAIL=
 RESEND_API_KEY=
```

You can get the `RESEND_API_KEY` from [Resend](https://resend.com/onboarding).

If you want to test in the development environment, you can view the printed `email`, `oneTimePassword`, and `emailVerificationCode` in the terminal.

## Social Logins

<Note>
  The **Github/Google**  OAuth credentials are not required if you are not using the Github/Google login feature. 
</Note>
### Google

Fill in the following client variables in the `.env` file.

```javascript
 NUXT_OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
 NUXT_OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

You can get theÂ `client_id`Â andÂ `client_secret`Â from Â [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
