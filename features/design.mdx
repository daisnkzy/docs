  }
});

## Landing Page

### Header & Footer Components

The `Header`and `Footer`components are in `app/layouts/default.vue`, ensuring they appear by default on all pages.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript layouts/default.vue
<template>
	<main id="default" class="relative flex flex-col w-full min-h-screen">
		<Navbar />
		<slot />
		<Footer />
	</main>
</template>

<style>
// You can customize the background color of the landing page here
#default {
	@apply bg-white dark:bg-[#08090a];
}
</style>
```

</CodeGroup>
<Note>
If you don't want your page to have `<Navbar />` or `<Footer />`, you can change your page layout with the following code.
</Note>


```javascript
<script setup>
definePageMeta({
	layout: "dashboard",
});
</script>
```

### Other Components

With a simple copy and paste, you can create a beautiful, high-converting landing page. ðŸ¥³

<CodeGroup>

```javascript app/pages/index.vue
<template>
	<div class="z-10">
		<Hero
			title="Jumpstart Your SaaS with Ease Designed for Beginners"
			description="Ease is a SaaS Starter Kit, simplifying the process of building a functional SaaS without worrying about landing pages, payments, SEO, or complex features."
		/>
		<LogoCloud />
		<Feature />
		<HowItWorks />
		<Pricing />
		<TestimonialGrid />
		<FAQ />
		<CTA />
	</div>
	<!-- <UIBackgroundRisingStars /> -->
	<UIBackgroundShadowGrid />
</template>
```

</CodeGroup>

Don't forget to Edit the copy to fit your business logic.
